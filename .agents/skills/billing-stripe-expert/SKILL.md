# Billing & Stripe Expert

## The 10 Commandments of Billing

### 1. Stripe Is the Source of Truth
**NEVER hardcode prices** (e.g., `$25`) anywhere in the codebase. All dollar amounts must come from the Stripe Product Catalog or the database cache of it.

- **Pricing singleton**: `server/core/billing/pricingConfig.ts`
  - `PRICING.OVERAGE_RATE_DOLLARS` / `PRICING.OVERAGE_RATE_CENTS` — dynamic getters
  - `PRICING.GUEST_FEE_DOLLARS` / `PRICING.GUEST_FEE_CENTS` — dynamic getters
  - `PRICING.OVERAGE_BLOCK_MINUTES` = 30 (business logic, not a price)
  - `updateOverageRate(cents)` and `updateGuestFee(cents)` — called at startup and via webhooks
- **Startup loader**: `server/loaders/startup.ts` fetches current prices from Stripe on boot
- **Webhook refresh**: `product.updated` / `price.updated` webhooks trigger `updateOverageRate()` / `updateGuestFee()`
- **Frontend hook**: `src/hooks/usePricing.ts` fetches dynamic pricing from the API — never import constants

**If you see a raw number like `2500` or `25` representing dollars/cents, it is a bug.**

### 2. Sessions = Money
A **Booking** (`booking_requests`) is just a calendar reservation. A **BookingSession** (`booking_sessions`) is the billable financial record. Every billable booking MUST have a session.

- **Mandatory function**: `ensureSessionForBooking()` in `server/core/bookingService/sessionManager.ts`
- Call this after every booking approval, Trackman link, or CSV import
- **3-step lookup chain** (v7.26.1): (1) match by `trackman_booking_id`, (2) match by `resource_id + session_date + start_time`, (3) match by time range overlap. Only INSERTs if all 3 fail.
- **Transaction-aware**: throws immediately on failure when called with a `client` (no retry). 500ms retry only with pool connections.
- Flags booking for staff review on persistent failure (never silently fails)
- Also: `createSessionWithUsageTracking()` — creates session + usage ledger entries + guest pass deductions atomically

### 3. No Ghost Sessions
When creating a session, MUST immediately link it to the **Booking ID** and the **User ID**.

- `createSession()` in `sessionManager.ts` requires `bookingId` and `userId`
- Link the session before any fee calculations run
- An unlinked session = lost revenue (no way to bill)

### 4. Webhooks Rule
Do NOT poll for payment status. Rely on Stripe Webhooks to update the database.

- **Webhook handler**: `server/core/stripe/webhooks.ts` — `processStripeWebhook()`
- Key events handled:
  - `payment_intent.succeeded` → marks payment as paid
  - `payment_intent.failed` → marks payment as failed
  - `payment_intent.canceled` → marks payment as canceled
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded` → subscription payment confirmed
  - `invoice.payment_failed` → triggers grace period logic
  - `checkout.session.completed` → day pass / membership purchase confirmed
  - `customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted` → membership lifecycle
  - `charge.refunded` → refund processing
  - `charge.dispute.created/closed` → dispute handling (suspends membership)
  - `product.updated/created/deleted` → pricing refresh
  - `price.updated/created` → pricing refresh
- **Route**: `server/routes/stripe/payments.ts` receives the raw webhook POST
- **Raw body required**: Webhook endpoint must receive `Buffer` payload (not JSON-parsed). Exclude Express JSON middleware from the webhook route.

### 5. Idempotency Is Key
All billing webhooks must check `event.id` to ensure the same payment is never processed twice.

- **Dedup table**: `webhook_processed_events` — stores `event_id`, `event_type`, `resource_id`, `processed_at`
- **Claim function**: `tryClaimEvent()` in `webhooks.ts`
  - Uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING RETURNING event_id`
  - If `rowCount === 0`, the event is a duplicate → skip
- **Transaction wrapping**: The entire webhook handler runs inside `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`. If the handler fails, `ROLLBACK` ensures the claim is also rolled back, so Stripe can retry.
- **Stripe API idempotency**: When creating payment intents, pass `idempotencyKey` to `stripe.paymentIntents.create()` (see `server/core/stripe/payments.ts`)
- **Cleanup**: Old processed events are pruned by scheduled maintenance

**CRITICAL — PaymentIntent dedup for bookings**:
Before creating ANY Stripe PaymentIntent for a booking, ALWAYS query `stripe_payment_intents` for an existing open intent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM stripe_payment_intents
WHERE booking_id = $1 AND status NOT IN ('succeeded', 'canceled', 'refunded')
```
If one exists, return it instead of creating a new one. `prepaymentService.ts` implements this pattern — follow it everywhere. Include `metadata.bookingId` on ALL payment intents for traceability.

### 6. Guest Fees
Guest fees are calculated based on filled slots in a booking that do NOT have a valid member assigned.

- **Calculation**: `computeFeeBreakdown()` in `server/core/billing/unifiedFeeService.ts`
- A participant is a "guest" only if they have NO `userId` (i.e., not a linked member)
- Members incorrectly marked as guests are NOT charged guest fees (explicit check)
- Placeholder guests (`Guest 1`, `Guest 2`) vs. real named guests have different treatment
- Empty booking slots generate synthetic guest fee line items
- Guest fee amount comes from `PRICING.GUEST_FEE_CENTS` (Commandment 1)
- **Guest pass system**: `server/core/billing/guestPassConsumer.ts` deducts from member's monthly allocation
- **Guest pass holds**: `server/core/billing/guestPassHoldService.ts` temporarily holds passes during booking flow before finalizing

### 7. Overage Fees
Overage is calculated in **30-minute blocks**. Use `computeFeeBreakdown()` — do NOT write custom math.

- **Block size**: `PRICING.OVERAGE_BLOCK_MINUTES` = 30 (business logic constant)
- **Rate**: `PRICING.OVERAGE_RATE_CENTS` (dynamic from Stripe, Commandment 1)
- **Calculation chain**:
  1. `computeUsageAllocation()` in `usageCalculator.ts` — divides session duration among participants
  2. `calculateOverageFee()` in `usageCalculator.ts` — computes overage based on minutes vs. daily allowance
  3. `computeFeeBreakdown()` in `unifiedFeeService.ts` — orchestrates everything
- **Duration rule**: Uses `GREATEST(session_duration, booking_duration)` to handle Trackman extensions
- **Prior usage**: Checks `usage_ledger` for same-day usage before calculating overage

### 8. Grace Periods
If a membership payment fails, do NOT cut off access immediately. Set status to `past_due` and allow the 3-day grace period logic to handle it.

- **Webhook trigger**: `invoice.payment_failed` → sets `membership_status = 'past_due'` and records `grace_period_start`
- **Scheduler**: `server/schedulers/gracePeriodScheduler.ts`
  - Runs periodically, checks `grace_period_start IS NOT NULL`
  - Sends escalating emails (tracked by `grace_period_email_count`)
  - After 3 days: suspends membership, clears grace period fields
- **Email templates**: `server/emails/paymentEmails.ts` — payment failure notifications
- **Do NOT**: Manually set `membership_status = 'cancelled'` on payment failure. Let the grace period scheduler handle the lifecycle.

### 9. Transactions
Any action that touches `booking_sessions`, `payments`, `stripe_payment_intents`, or `booking_fee_snapshots` tables MUST be wrapped in a database transaction.

- Pattern: `const client = await pool.connect(); await client.query('BEGIN'); ... await client.query('COMMIT');`
- Always use `try/catch/finally` with `client.release()` in `finally`
- On error: `await client.query('ROLLBACK');`
- **Webhook transactions**: The entire webhook handler is wrapped in a single transaction. If any handler fails, all DB changes roll back.
- **Fee calculations**: `calculateAndCacheParticipantFees()` in `feeCalculator.ts` wraps its multi-table updates in a transaction
- **Payment status**: `PaymentStatusService` methods (`markPaymentSucceeded`, `markPaymentRefunded`) use transactions to update snapshots + intents + participants atomically

### 10. Logs
Log all payment failures or unexpected billing states to the error alert system immediately.

- **Error alert module**: `server/core/errorAlerts.ts`
  - Sends email alerts via Resend to the configured alert address
  - Built-in protections: 4-hour cooldown per alert type, 3 alerts/day cap, 5-minute startup grace period
  - Filters transient errors (ECONNRESET, rate limits, etc.) to avoid noise
- **Logger**: `server/core/logger.ts` — structured logging for all billing events
- **Audit log**: `server/core/auditLog.ts` — `logFromRequest()` for all staff billing actions
- Always log: payment intent creation, payment success/failure, refund processing, subscription changes, dispute events, reconciliation mismatches

## Fee Order of Operations (Cross-Reference)

See `booking-import-standards/SKILL.md` Rule 15a for the MANDATORY fee calculation order:
Status → Staff → Active Membership → Tier → Unlimited → Social → Usage → Overage Blocks

**Key reminders:**
- Cancelled bookings = $0 (no further checks)
- Staff = $0 (no further checks)
- Inactive member = treated as guest, fee charged to HOST (not to the inactive participant)

## Anti-Patterns — NEVER Do These

1. **Never hardcode `$25`, `2500`, or any dollar amount** — always use `PRICING.*` from `pricingConfig.ts`
2. **Never create a booking without calling `ensureSessionForBooking()`** — sessions = money
3. **Never call `stripe.customers.create()` directly** — use `getOrCreateStripeCustomer()`
4. **Never instantiate `new Stripe(...)` directly** — use `getStripeClient()`
5. **Never poll Stripe for payment status** — rely on webhooks
6. **Never call external APIs inside a webhook transaction** — use the Deferred Action pattern
7. **Never set `membership_status = 'cancelled'` on payment failure** — set `past_due` and let grace period scheduler handle it
8. **Never write fee calculation math** — use `computeFeeBreakdown()` from `unifiedFeeService.ts`
9. **Never update `booking_sessions` or `stripe_payment_intents` outside a transaction**
10. **Never skip idempotency checks in webhook handlers** — always call `tryClaimEvent()`
11. **Never parse webhook body as JSON before signature verification** — it must be a raw `Buffer`
12. **Never create a PaymentIntent without checking for an existing open intent** — query `stripe_payment_intents` first (Commandment 5)
